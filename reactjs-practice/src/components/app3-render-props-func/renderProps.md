<!-- **Render Props is a React pattern where a component receives a function as a prop and calls it to decide what to render.** -->

<!-- **📌 The term “render prop” literally means: a prop whose value is a function that returns JSX.** -->

<!-- Why use render props?

✅ Share logic between components
✅ Avoid duplication
✅ More flexible than higher-order components
✅ UI fully controlled by parent -->
